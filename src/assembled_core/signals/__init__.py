"""Signal generation modules.

This package handles:
- Trading signal generation from technical indicators
- Signal rules (trend-following, mean-reversion, etc.)
- Signal filtering and validation
- Signal combination (multi-strategy)

Note: Current EMA crossover signals are in pipeline.signals.compute_ema_signals.
This package will provide a broader signal generation framework.
