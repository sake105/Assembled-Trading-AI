"""Technical analysis features and feature engineering modules.

This package handles:
- Technical indicators (EMA, SMA, RSI, MACD, etc.)
- Feature engineering for machine learning
- Feature normalization and scaling
- Feature selection

Note: Current EMA logic is in pipeline.signals.compute_ema_signals.
This package will provide a broader set of technical indicators.
