"""Order execution and simulation modules.

This package handles:
- Order generation from signals
- Order routing and execution simulation
- Execution cost modeling
- Order validation

Note: Current order generation is in pipeline.orders.signals_to_orders.
This package will provide more sophisticated execution logic.
